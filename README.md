# Numpy_Sales_Project


## Overview
This project demonstrates a practical use of **Python and NumPy** to analyze sales data for a week. The tool calculates **total, average, highest, and lowest sales**, identifies **best and worst performing days**, and highlights **above-average and below-average sales days**.

---

## Features
- Input daily sales values.
- Calculate **Total Sales** and **Average Daily Sales**.
- Identify **Highest and Lowest Sales** with corresponding days.
- Highlight **Best and Worst Performing Days**.
- Filter **Above-Average** and **Below-Average** sales days.

---

## How It Works
1. Sales data is stored in a **NumPy array**.
2. **NumPy functions** like `np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, `np.max()`, `np.min()`, `np.argmax()`, and `np.argmin()` perform calculations efficiently.
3. **Boolean indexing** is used to find above-average and below-average days.
4. Results are displayed in a clear, readable format.
